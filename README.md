# Predict Body Mass Index Category(BMI)

Description:

A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight.
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female

Height : Number (cm)

Weight : Number (Kg)

Index :
1. 0 - Extremely Weak
2. 1 - Weak
3. 2 - Normal
4. 3 - Overweight
5. 4 - Obesity
6. 5 - Extreme Obesity

Objective:

1. Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

2. Build regression models to predict the various categories of BMI.(It could be classification, it depends on you)

3. Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious regression algorithms.
