# Predict Body Mass Index(BMI)

Description:

A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight.
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female

Height : Number (cm)

Weight : Number (Kg)

Index :

1. Extremely Weak

2. Weak

3. Normal

4. Overweight

5. Obesity

6. Extreme Obesity


Objective:

1. Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

2. Build Regression models to predict the various categories of BMI.

3. Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious regression algorithms.
